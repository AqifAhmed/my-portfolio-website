            <p class="blog-excerpt">This was the final project of The Odin Project’s Foundations course, and it tied everything together — HTML, CSS,
            JavaScript, and DOM manipulation.
            
            The structure was straightforward: a simple calculator layout with a display and buttons for numbers, operators, clear,
            decimal, and equals. Using event listeners, I managed the logic for basic arithmetic operations and user input.
            
            One of the interesting parts was adding keyboard support. I had to map keyboard keys like / to their respective buttons
            like ÷, and ensure input chaining didn’t break the app — especially with negatives or repeated operators. I even caught
            and fixed a NaN+ bug caused by incomplete input.
            
            Seeing it all come together and then deploying it through GitHub Pages felt super satisfying — like building something
            from scratch and actually using it. Simple, but powerful!</p>

            <p class="blog-excerpt">As I navigated through the Assignment at hand, I realized that it required the
              understanding of DOM Manipulation, for which I went to MDN for more explanations to it. It is a simple
              design in which the user first enters a number for which the loop creates a grid. Those squares are
              colored black with opacity set to '0.1'. As soon as the mouse hovers through any block, it's opacity
              starts to increase and it gives a perspective how those paint applications that we have been using since
              childhood, work!</p>
